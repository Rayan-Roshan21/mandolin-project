History from primary neurologist, clinic visit and patient and father at bedside. Patient referred to Dr. Gu by Dr. Fazal in East Bay. Confirms predominant symptoms since April of numbness in his right hand and urinary hesitancy/urgency. Additionally reporting right eye pain since time of clinic visit this morning. MRI brain and spine obtained following clinic visit and multiple lesions noted on brain and spine suggestive of pediatric MS. Presents for admission for IVMP.\n",
